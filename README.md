# My Rust-Raylib Workbook

Welcome and thanks for visiting! I use this repo to learn [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) programming in Rust and share something worthwhile with the rest of the world.

- [Raylib Intro Course](https://github.com/csaatechnicalarts/rust-raylib-workbook/tree/main/raylib-intro-course) - Inspired by [raysan5's repo](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib-intro-course?tab=readme-ov-file) for developing simple games using raylib-C.
