# My Rust-Raylib Workbook

Welcome and thanks for visiting! I use this repo to learn [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/) programming in Rust and share something worthwhile with the rest of the world. I've developed these projects mainly in an Ubuntu Linux environment.

- **Raylib Intro Course** - Inspired by [raysan5's repo](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib-intro-course?tab=readme-ov-file) for developing simple games using raylib-C. Apart from a means for me to learn raylib concepts, my workspace ports the original C code of the game to Rust.
- **Raylib Alphabet Rangoli** - Using the letters of the English alphabet, this simple program generates Rangoli-inspired patterns.
